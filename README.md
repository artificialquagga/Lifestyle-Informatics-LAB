The design of an ambient agent supporting humans in intensive visual tasks. 

Project for the course LAB LI, VU Amsterdam, May 2016

This projects concerns an ambient agent model, designed to improve the attention on certain objects
of a 'Missile Command' player. Detailed conceptual models have been created for the domain,
analysis and support. The domain model describes the attention of the player and how it is
determined. The analysis model describes how the ambient agent reasons, based on the domain
model, and determines the attention discrepancy. The support model describes how, in the event of
attention discrepancy, the ambient agent provides support to the player. Each model will be
described in detail, including its concepts, relations and formalisation.
